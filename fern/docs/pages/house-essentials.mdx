## Thermostat & HVAC System

- The house has one HVAC zone that controls the entire house.

- Use the fans in the bedrooms to help adjust the temperature in individual rooms.

## Dishware & Cookware

- **Handwash only:** All pots, pans, sheet pans, and wooden utensils should be handwashed.

- **Dishwasher safe:** All plates, bowls, cups, and similar items can go in the dishwasher.

- **Microwave safe:** All ceramic mugs and dishware are safe to use in the microwave.

## Coffee

- We have a Nespresso machine. Please refill the water tank before use.

- Extra pods and a bag for used pods are stored in the cabinet below the machine.

- **To use:** Lift the lever, insert the pod with the round side facing down, press the lever down, then press the brew button.

## Trash & Recycling

- **Recycling:** Cardboard, tin, glass, paper, and #1 & #2 plastic only.

- **Trash:** Everything else goes in the regular trash.

- If the bins are full, place the bag in the garage.

## Food

- Feel free to use items from the pantry or freezer. If you finish something, please replace it for the next guests.

## Laundry

- Turn on the laundry room fan (using the switch) when using the machines to keep the room cool.

- Empty the lint trap from the dryer before each use.
