## Septic System

Please flush **toilet paper only**. All other items should go in the trash.

## Rainwater

The house runs entirely on rainwater. Operate everything normally, just be a little mindful of usage. 

**Turning water ON (on arrival):**

In the storage closet through the laundry room, plug in the water heater and hot water circulator.

**Shutting water OFF (on departure):**

In the storage closet through the laundry room, unplug the water heater and hot water circulator. 

## Disposal

Only soft foods. No eggshells, bones, or other hard items.

## Outdoor Shower

To use it, turn it on under the sink in the kid's bathroom.

# For guests staying May-Oct

The water system will have been shut off for the summer season, so you'll have to re-establish a consistent water level and pressure for the house.

Follow all the above steps inside the house. Then, walk towards the water tank to the green lid with an orange stake next to it. Turn the red knob closed. When you leave, turn the knob open again and any water in the system should flush out the pipe.
